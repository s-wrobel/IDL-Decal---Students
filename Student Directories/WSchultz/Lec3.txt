GIT!!!!!! OOOOOOOOOOOO

add vs commit


git remote will tell you where teh git repository is set up

strings

words and shit

print, strlen(blah)

strcompress(blah, /remove_all)

lots of different options for the funtions we are being shown, look into
more if want to make code prettier

strjoin(blah, '.') - joins strings together by a .

strsplit(blah, '.') outputs the location of all the .s
strsplit(blah, '.', /extract) pulls out the things delineated by a .

repstr(string, string part, replacement part)
